                <p class="blurb" >Alone at night in your quiet, empty house, a noise pulls you from your thoughts. Do you brush it off and try to
                    sleep,
                    or let curiosity pull you deeper into the shadows?
                
                    A Night at Home is an interactive game that challenges players to navigate a maze of creeping dread and uneasy
                    choices.
                    As the house shifts around you, and strange events draw you toward something sinister, it’s up to you to decide how
                    far
                    you’ll go when fear gnaws at the edges of your sanity.
                
                    Will you face the darkness, or will you turn away and hope it’s only your imagination?</p>
