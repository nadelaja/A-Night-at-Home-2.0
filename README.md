# A Night at Home 2.0

## Grad Write-up
A Night at Home 2.0 is my original twine game, revamped for my grad student project. I've built a new interface for my game and added/upgraded several things. It now has 3 distinct pages: a home page, a gates page for quick navigation to important passages and events, a story page with additional navigation for the game itself and an animated favicon (it doesn't work in chrome). I have code for saving and save points that I'm still trying to debug, but I hope to have it working soon. I've also stripped out a lot of the Twine 2 animations and am working on coming up with visual equivalents on my own. There's not audio implementation as of yet, and I couldn't think of a way to work in the fear bar that wasn't redundant, so I dropped that idea as well


## Game Summary

Alone at night in your quiet, empty house, a noise pulls you from your thoughts. Do you brush it off and try to sleep, or let curiosity pull you deeper into the shadows? A Night at Home is an interactive game that challenges players to navigate a maze of creeping dread and uneasy choices. As the house shifts around you, and strange events draw you toward something sinister, it’s up to you to decide how far you’ll go when fear gnaws at the edges of your sanity. Will you face the darkness, or will you turn away and hope it’s only your imagination?
