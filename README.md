# A Night at Home 2.0
## Grad Write-up
A Night at Home 2.0 is my original Twine game, reimagined for my graduate student project. I've rebuilt the interface and introduced several key enhancements. The game now features three distinct pages: a welcoming home page, a gates page for quick navigation to critical passages and events, and an immersive story page with navigation options.

I've stripped away the standard Twine 2 animations, focusing instead on developing custom visual elements that will compliment the narrative .I'm currently refining  and debugging the game's save functionality. Audio implementation is still incomplete, and the initial fear bar concept has been set aside for now.

## Game Summary
Alone at night in your quiet, empty house, a noise pulls you from your thoughts. Do you brush it off and try to sleep, or let curiosity pull you deeper into the shadows? A Night at Home is an interactive game that challenges players to navigate a maze of creeping dread and uneasy choices. As the house shifts around you, and strange events draw you toward something sinister, it’s up to you to decide how far you’ll go when fear gnaws at the edges of your sanity. Will you face the darkness, or will you turn away and hope it’s only your imagination?
