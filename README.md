# A Night at Home 2.0
A revamp of sorts for my grad student project. I've built a new interface for my twine game and added and upgraded several things. It now has 3 disctinct pages, a home page, a gates page for quick navigation to imprtant passages, and a story page with additional navigation for the game itself. I couldn't really think of a way to work in the fear bar that wasn't redundant, so I dropped. I have code for saving and save points that I'm still trying to debug and get to function, but I hope to have it working soon. Will add audio soon as well.


Game Summary
Alone at night in your quiet, empty house, a noise pulls you from your thoughts. Do you brush it off and try to sleep, or let curiosity pull you deeper into the shadows? A Night at Home is an interactive game that challenges players to navigate a maze of creeping dread and uneasy choices. As the house shifts around you, and strange events draw you toward something sinister, it’s up to you to decide how far you’ll go when fear gnaws at the edges of your sanity. Will you face the darkness, or will you turn away and hope it’s only your imagination?
